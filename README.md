# Resume
I started this project, build my resume in HTML, so I could easily update it and maintain consistent formatting and spacing of items.
The Resume.html file can be opened in chrome and then downloaded as a PDF for job applications. Given the single use nature of the project, I will only checking the HTML is supported in the latest version of chrome.
